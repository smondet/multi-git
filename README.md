Git: Multi-Repository
=====================

This project provides a couple of scripts which handle multiple Git
repositories at once. One can provide a list of directories to scan for
repositories (non-recursively) on the command line or through Git's
configuration mechanism.

The scripts provided as of now are:

- `git-multi-status`: Show the status of a bunch of Git repositories.
- `git-activity-report`: Make a report of developments in a bunch of Git repositories.


It may be interesting for the user to also alias them in
`~/.gitconfig`, for instance:


    [alias]
        mst = multi-status --show-modified
        arfd = activity-report --since


See below for detailed usage information ⮷.

Usage: Git-multi-status
-----------------------

See `git-multi-status --help`:

```
usage: git-multi-status <args>
Show the status of a bunch of Git repositories.

Use `git multi-status /path/to/repos1 /path/to/repos2` to display
a compact report of all the git repositories found in the folders 
`/path/to/repos1` and `/path/to/repos2`.

Default paths to explore can be set in Git's configuration:

    git config --global --add multi-git.paths /path/to/repos1
    git config --global --add multi-git.paths /path/to/repos2


Options:

* `--show-modified`: Show the list of modified files.
* `--no-config`: Do not look at the `multi-git.paths` git-config option.
* `--version`: Show version information.
* `--describe`: Show the status of a bunch of Git repositories
```

Usage: Git-activity-report
--------------------------

See `git-activity-report --help`:

```
usage: git-activity-report <args>
Make a report of developments in a bunch of Git repositories.

Use `git activity-report --since 2018-10-23 /path/to/repos1 /path/to/repos2` to display
a detailed “recent happenings” report of all the git repositories found
in the folders `/path/to/repos1` and `/path/to/repos2`.

Default paths to explore can be set in Git's configuration:

    git config --global --add multi-git.paths /path/to/repos1
    git config --global --add multi-git.paths /path/to/repos2


Options:

* `--no-config`: Do not look at the `multi-git.paths` git-config option.
* `--since <string>`: Date to get the logs/information since (default: “last sunday”).
* `--section-base <string>`: The base markdown section ('##', '###', etc. default: ###)
* `--version`: Show version information.
* `--describe`: Make a report of developments in a bunch of Git repositories
```

**Current Limitations:**

- Often, there are redundancies between branches that the script does
not detect.



Authors / Making-of
-------------------

This repository is generated by an OCaml program which itself was
written by [Seb Mondet](https://seb.mondet.org), it uses the
[Genspio](https://smondet.gitlab.io/genspio-doc/) EDSL library, and
serves as one of its examples of usage, see also its
[implementation](https://github.com/hammerlab/genspio/tree/master/src/examples/multigit.ml).

Similarly, you may check out the <https://github.com/smondet/cosc>
repository, which is also a bunch of shell scripts maintained by an
OCaml program.

Example Session / Demo
----------------------

Let's see a sequence of examples to demo the scripts. First, we prepare
a set of *“test”* repositories in `/tmp/git-repos-example`:

    $ mkdir -p /tmp/git-repos-example/hammerlab
    $ mkdir -p /tmp/git-repos-example/smondet
    $ mkdir -p /tmp/git-repos-example/tezos
    $ git clone https://github.com/hammerlab/ketrew.git \
      /tmp/git-repos-example/hammerlab/ketrew
    $ git clone https://github.com/hammerlab/biokepi.git \
      /tmp/git-repos-example/hammerlab/biokepi
    $ git clone https://github.com/hammerlab/genspio.git \
      /tmp/git-repos-example/hammerlab/genspio
    $ git clone https://github.com/hammerlab/coclobas.git \
      /tmp/git-repos-example/hammerlab/coclobas
    $ git clone https://gitlab.com/smondet/genspio-doc.git \
      /tmp/git-repos-example/smondet/genspio-doc
    $ git clone https://gitlab.com/smondet/vecosek.git \
      /tmp/git-repos-example/smondet/vecosek
    $ git clone https://gitlab.com/tezos/tezos.git \
      /tmp/git-repos-example/tezos/tezos


For now, we haven't changed anything to the repositories so the
“multi-status” is full of zeros (we use the `--no-config` option to
get consistent output w.r.t. users' configuration):

    $ git multi-status --no-config /tmp/git-repos-example/hammerlab \
      /tmp/git-repos-example/smondet /tmp/git-repos-example/tezos

The activity-report is, for now, more interesting, and it outputs
directly Markdown:

    $ git activity-report --section-base '####' --since 2018-10-20 \
      --no-config /tmp/git-repos-example/hammerlab \
      /tmp/git-repos-example/smondet /tmp/git-repos-example/tezos

Let's do some modifications:

Now in the multi-status we can see the modified files, the untracked
counts, and one branch is “ahead” (since we used `-t master` while
creating, it has a remote to define it):
